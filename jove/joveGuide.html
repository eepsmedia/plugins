<h1>How to be Galileo</h1>
<p>
    The "Jove" CODAP plugin lets you simulate being Galileo.
    On clear nights, you see Jupiter and its nearby moons.
    The plugin records the positions of the moons in a data table.
    You can graph the data to figure out more about the universe&mdash;or at least about the planet and its moons.

    It might be cloudy, in which case the sky is gray.
    If so, there's nothing to do but wait til tomorrow.
    (Press the <strong>tomorrow</strong> button.)
</p>
<p>
    To graph your data, first make a graph by clicking the graph icon in the tool bar,
    then label your axes by dragging column headings from the table to the axes of the graph.
    For your first graph, put <code>t</code> (time) on the horizontal axis.
    Then put <code>x</code> on the vertical axis.
    (For now, all values of <code>y</code> are zero.)
</p>
<p>
    Here are some things you can do:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Figure out which moon is which.
        You can label individual observations in the table,
        for example, you can try to label one moon as <code>A</code>
        by entering <code>A</code> in the <code>name</code> column.
    </li>
    <li>
        Drag <code>name</code> to the middle of the graph to label the points.
    </li>
    <li>
        Select all the points from one moon and then hide them using the "eyeball"
        inspector in the graph.
        This might make it easier to track a different moon.
    </li>
    <li>
        Figure out the period of a moon.
    </li>
    <li>
        Model a moon's <code>x</code> graph with a function.
        Look in the graph's "ruler" inspector to find how to enter a function.
        Don't forget: the argument of a sine function is in <i>radians</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Figure out the relationship between a moon's period and the radius of its orbit.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you want to make your life easier (but why would you?)
    you can check either or both of the options boxes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>no clouds</strong> means you get data every day, no gaps!
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>include moon names</strong> means you don't have to figure out the names.
        You get the true Jovian names: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
    </li>
</ul>
