# Mazu/fish: a commons game

This pair of apps constitute a commons game suitable for middle grades and up (and up). 

**Mazu** is the "teacher" app that lets you create a game.

**Fish** is the "player" or "student" app.

## fish: instructions for students

### Getting started 

When you open the game, you will see a box for the **game code**. 
The teacher (or game leader) will give you that code. 
It will consist of three words separated by periods, such as `house.dog.limit`.

Enter that code, press **Join**, then enter your name in the box that follows. 
For now, it's essential that no one else uses the same name in that particular game...so be sure that's organized in your game or class!

### Regular game play
Then you'll see a display that tells you the year (such as 2022, in a yellow box) and asks how many fish you want to catch.
Type a number and click **Catch**. 
You may see some data in a CODAP table while you wait for two things:
* Everyone else to decide how many fish they want and press **Catch**.
* Then, the teacher has to end the turn by running the fish market.

At that point, all the fish are sold, you receive your money, and the year changes to the next year.

Then you decide, again, how many fish to catch, and the cycle continues until the game is over.

### Ending the game, etc.
When does the game end? 
What's the object of the game?

Those are great questions. 
See if you can figure out answers to those questions and more as you play.
You will probably need to play more than one game to understand how to play well.

### Using data to help understand
You might also want to analyze some of the data that appear on the screen.
To do that, use CODAP.

For example, you might see how **seen** (the number of fish you see during the year) varies with **year**.
1. Make a graph by pressing the **Graph** button on the toolbar.
2. Drag the column heading **year** to the graph's horizontal axis.
3. Drag **seen** to the vertical axis.

As you play, the graph will update. 
Consider making more graphs, for example, a graph of **before** with **year**.

### Some data definitions:

| term | definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| **year** | the game year |
|**seen** | how many fish you saw from your boat |
|**want** | how many fish you said you wanted to catch |
|**caught** | how many you caught |
|**before** | how much money you had at the beginning of the year |
|**after** | how much you had at the end |
|**expenses**| how much is cost to keep your business open |
|**unitPrice**|how much money you got for each fish |
|**income**|you total income, that is, **caught** x **unitPrice** |

## Mazu: instructions for the teacher

Mazu is a Chinese goddess of the sea. And today, that's you! 
You are in charge of this game.

### Getting set up

To begin, enter a username and press **login**. 
For now, this game is ridiculously low-security. 
There is no password.
Just remember your name so you can find your games again later.

Then decide if you want a new game or an old game. 
For an old game, pick its code from the menu and click **join game**.
If you want a new game, press that button, choose a "level" from the menu (start with `albacore`) and click **new game**.

You will see the game code, which consists of three words separated by periods, as in `house.dog.limit`.

Tell all the players that code. 
They need to enter it into their computers to join the game.

## Game play
As they join, you will see their names appearing in a table on your screen. 
You will also see when they decide how many fish they want, 
and you will see their "status" change from `fishing` to `selling`.

When everyone is done fishing, you can press the **sell fish** button to activate the fish market.
Then everyone's fish are sold, 
and on their computers, they see their money arrive and they get another chance to decide on a number of fish and go catch them.

You will see your table change as they do so.
When everyone has fished, you press **sell fish**, and the cycle continues until the game ends. 

## What else?
Everyone has to press their **Catch** button or no one can move forward. 
So you may have to remind a student (player) to do that.

It is deliberately unclear how the game ends. 
Do your best not to tell students what you think or know, 
but rather ask them what they think.
Promote a discussion about that.

Notice that the discussion might center on two very different topics:
* What are the *game* rules, that is, what happens for the game to decide if you have won or lost.
* What do the game rules *mean*, that is, what winning or losing has to do with the fishing business and the health of the sea.

Also, students may eventually notice that when the game ends, 
it's the whole group that has either won or lost---not an individual.
