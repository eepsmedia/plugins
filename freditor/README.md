A new take on accessing the formula editor.

Drag the attribute whose formula you want to see or edit into the box.

For now, of course, you get no help at all.
No typeahead, no syntax coloring. 
The idea is just to see what it's like to have a nonmodal formula editor!

## suggestion
Using the sample document, make a new column for *range*. 
Then give it the formula *tMax - tMin*.
