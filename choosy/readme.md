# Choosy

## Attribute tab

Use the visibility icons (eyes) to hide or show attributes. 
This is the same as choosing hide or show attribute from the attribute's menu in CODAP...
except that you can show single attributes instead of "all hidden."

### clumps
You can also group attributes into "clumps," which you can expand and collapse using the disclosure triangles. 
There you can also show and hide clumps as a group.

For example, in a dataset about people, you might have five attributes about work and income. 
To make a clump called `work`, type "work" into the text box in the **attributes** tab. 
Now when you click the green "plus" icon, that attribute gets put into the `work` clump.

When an attribute is in a clump, you can remove it by clicking the red "minus" icon.
At that point it goes back to the "no-clump" zone at the top of the list.

### levels
Instead of using clumps to group attributes, you can use their position in the hierarchy.
Choose this mode by picking **levels** instead of **clumps** at th etop of the **attributes** tab.

## Tag cases tab

You can "tag" cases with a label that you type into the box.

The basic idea is to select the cases in CODAP, then tag them in `choosy`. There are three modes for tagging:

* **simple**: You tag the selection with the string in the box.
* **binary**: You tag the selection with the string in the first box, and also tag everything that is *not* selected with the string in the second box.
Use this to divide the dataset into two complementary groups, e.g., `tall` and `short` or `$` and `$$`.
* **random**: Enter the percentage of cases that will be in "group A" and give labels to group A and group B. Use this to create a training set.
