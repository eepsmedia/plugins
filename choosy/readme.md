# Choosy

## Attribute tab

Use the visibility icons to hide or show attributes. This is the same as choosing hide or show attribute from the attribute's menu in CODAP.

You can also group attributes into "clumps," which you can expand and collapse using the disclosure triangles. 
There you can also show and hide clumps as a group.

## Tag cases tab

You can "tag" cases with a label which you type into the box.

The basic idea is to select the cases in CODAP, then tag them in `choosy`. There are three modes for tagging:

* **simple**: You tag the selection with the string in the box.
* **binary**: You tag the selection with the string in the first box, and also tag everything that is *not* selected with the string in the second box.
Use this to divide the dataset into two complementary groups, e.g., `tall` and `short` or `$` and `$$`.
* **random**: Enter the percentage of cases that will be in "group A" and give labels to group A and group B. Use this to create a training set.
