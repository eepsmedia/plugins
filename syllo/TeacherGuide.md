# The syllo plugin

This plugin implements the "Wason" task, 
which probes and enhances the student's understanding
of some logical principles
(particularly _modus tollens_,
better known in English as _denying the consequent_.)

The user sees four cards with letters or numbers, 
for example,

**A 7 X 4**

and the claim that there is a "rule" that states (for example)
that if a card shows a vowel, then the opposite side
shows an odd number.

The user can then flip cards over to see if the rule is correct. 

> Exactly how to phrase this process to a student is difficult.
> Is it possible that the rule is _not_ correct?
> What exactly is the student's task?

The idea is for the student to turn over as few cards as possible
to do this verification.

This minimum number is two!

In our case, the student should turn over the **A**
(to ensure that an odd number is on the reverse)
and (and this is the crux of he matter) 
the **4**
(to ensure that there is _not_ a vowel on the reverse).
