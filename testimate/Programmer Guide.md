# testimate programmer's guide

## Communicating with CODAP

* User drops attributes into drop-target objects in the UI. 
This lets them specify what variables they are testing. 
This requires working with drop notifications.
* User can ask for test/estimate results to be emitted into a 
CODAP file. 
* In the case of multiple, repeated sampling and testing,
this requires interacting with `rerandomize`.
