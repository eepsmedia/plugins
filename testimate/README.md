# testimate

This plugin lets you perform the traditional, frequentist, parametric tests that AP Stats requires.

Drag attributes onto the spaces provided. 
The space on the left if for the pricipal, "outcome" variable. 
For a test with only one variable, put the corresponding attribute there.

For tests with two variables, put th esecondary (or predictor) variable on the right. 

Choose a suitable test from the menu.
The menu shows the tests tht "work" given the types of attributes in the spaces. 
The plugin tries to infer types from the data,
but sometimes you have to tell it, 
for example, with the Titanic `Class` attribute, which has values of 1, 2, and 3, but is really categorical.
To change the type of an attribute, click the `123/abc` button.
