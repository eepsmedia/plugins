# Forest: A game about resources and the Tragedy of the Commons

## Forest: instructions for students

### Getting started

When you open the game, you will see a box for your handle. Enter your name.
Then you see another box for the **game code**.
The teacher (or game leader) will give you that code.
It will consist of three words separated by periods, such as `house.dog.limit`.

Enter that code, press **Join**.
For now, it's essential that no one else uses the same name in that particular game...so be sure that's organized in your game or class!

### Regular game play
Then you'll see a display that tells you the year (such as 2025) and shows you a forest of (triangular) trees.
Click the trees you want to harvest (limit: 10) and press **Harvest**.
Now you wait for
* Everyone else to harvest their trees.
* Then, the teacher has to end the turn by selling all the trees you cut down.

At that point, all the trees are sold, you receive your money, and the year changes to the next year.
You will see a financial report for the previous year.

Then you decide, again, how many trees to cut, and the cycle continues until the game is over.

### Ending the game, etc.
When does the game end?
What's the object of the game?

Those are great questions.
See if you can figure out answers to those questions and more as you play.
You will probably need to play more than one game to understand how to play well.


## Forest: instructions for the teacher

Aranyani is a Hindu goddess of the forests. And today, that's you!
You are in charge of this game.

### Getting set up

To begin, enter a username ("handle") and press **login**.
For now, this game is ridiculously low-security.
There is no password.

To create a new game, choose a "level" from the menu (start with `vanilla`) and click **new game**.
You might want to make a short game first so students learn the mechanics.

You will see the game code, which consists of three words separated by periods, as in `house.dog.limit`.

Tell all the players that code.
They need to enter it into their computers to join the game.

## Game play
As they join, you will see their names appearing in a table on your screen.
You will also see when they decide which trees they want to harvest.

When everyone is done harvesting, you can press the **market** button to activate the wood market.
Then everyone's trees are sold.
On their computers, students see their money arrive, and they get another chance to decide on a number of trees to cut down.

The cycle continues until the game ends.

### Using data to help understand
You might also want to analyze some of the data that appear on the screen.
To do that, use CODAP.

For example, you might see how **seen** (the number of fish you see during the year) varies with **year**.
1. Make a graph by pressing the **Graph** button on the toolbar.
2. Drag the column heading **year** to the graph's horizontal axis.
3. Drag **seen** to the vertical axis.

As you play, the graph will update.
Consider making more graphs, for example, a graph of **before** with **year**.

### Some data definitions:

| term               | definition                                           |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **year**           | the game year                                        |
| **biomass**        | the total "mass" of all the trees in the forest      |
| **averageBalance** | the mean balance (money) of all the teams            |

## What else?
Everyone has to press their **Harvest** button or no one can move forward.
So you may have to remind a student (player) to do that.

It is deliberately unclear how the game ends.
Do your best not to tell students what you think or know,
but rather ask them what they think.
Promote a discussion about that.

Notice that the discussion might center on two very different topics:
* What are the *game* rules, that is, what happens for the game to decide if you have won or lost?
* What do the game rules *mean*, that is, what winning or losing has to do with the forestry business and the health of the forest?

Also, students may eventually notice that when the game ends,
it's the whole group that has either won or lost---not an individual.
