# Forest: A game about resources and the Tragedy of the Commons

## Forest: instructions for students

### Getting started

When you open the game, you will see a box for your handle. Enter your name.
Then you see another box for the **game code**.
The teacher (or game leader) will give you that code.
It will consist of three words separated by periods, such as `house.dog.limit`.

Enter that code, press **Join**.
Your name will get five digits appended (like, `tim71644`).
This is in case two people have the same name.

### Regular game play
Then you'll see a display that tells you the year (such as 2025) and shows you a forest of (triangular) trees.
Click the trees you want to harvest (limit: 10) and press **Harvest**.
Now you wait...
* Everyone else to harvest their trees.
* Then, the teacher has to end the turn by selling all the trees you cut down.

At that point, all the trees are sold, you receive your money, and the year changes to the next year.
You will see a financial report for the previous year.

Then you decide, again, how many trees to cut, and the cycle continues until the game is over.

### Ending the game, etc.
When does the game end?
What's the object of the game?

Those are great questions.
See if you can figure out answers to those questions and more as you play.
You will probably need to play more than one game to understand how to play well.


## Forest: instructions for the teacher

Aranyani is a Hindu goddess of the forests. And today, that's you!
You are in charge of this game.

### Getting set up

To begin, enter a username ("handle") and press **login**.
For now, this game is ridiculously low-security.
There is no password.

To create a new game, choose a "level" from the menu (start with `vanilla`) and click **new game**.
You might want to make a "short" game first so students learn the mechanics.

You will see the game code, which consists of three words separated by periods, as in `house.dog.limit`.

Tell all the players that code.
They need to enter it into their computers to join the game.
You will see their names appear on your screen as they join.

Once **all** students have joined, press the button to start the game. 

Very important: wait for all students to join before you start the game! 
The number of trees depends on the number of players, 
so once the game starts, no one new can join. 

## Game play
After students choose which trees to harvest,
you can see that list on your screen.
When all students have made their choices, the `sell trees` button appears.

When you press `sell trees`, everyone's trees are sold.
On their computers, students see a report on that year's finances, 
and they get another chance to decide which trees to cut down.

The cycle continues until the game ends.

### Using data to help understand
You might also want to analyze some of the data that appear on the screen.
To do that, use CODAP.

To get the data from your game into CODAP, do the following:
1. Click the "copy" icon near the upper right of your `Aranyani` window. This copies data to the clipboard.
2. Open a blank CODAP document. (https://codap.concord.org.app)
3. Go to the `Tables` tool. Click it and choose **new from clipboard**.

For example, you might see how **biomass** (the total "weight" of all the trees) varies with **year**.
1. Make a graph by pressing the **Graph** button on the toolbar.
2. Drag the column heading **year** to the graph's horizontal axis.
3. Drag **biomass** to the vertical axis.

To update the data, re-copy it using the copy icon. 
In CODAP, go to Tables again and again choose **new from clipboard**. 
You will have an option to replace the data in your table.

### Some data definitions:

| term               | definition                                           |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **year**           | the game year                                        |
| **biomass**        | the total "mass" of all the trees in the forest      |
| **averageBalance** | the mean balance (money) of all the teams            |

## What else?
Everyone has to press their **Harvest** button or no one can move forward.
So you may have to remind a student (player) to do that.

It is deliberately unclear how the game ends.
Do your best not to tell students what you think or know,
but rather ask them what they think.
Promote a discussion about that.

Notice that the discussion might center on two very different topics:
* What are the *game* rules, that is, what happens for the game to decide if you have won or lost?
* What do the game rules *mean*, that is, what winning or losing has to do with the forestry business and the health of the forest?

Also, students may eventually notice that when the game ends,
it's the whole group that has either won or lost---not an individual.
