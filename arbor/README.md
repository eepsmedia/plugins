## Opening attribute configuration on split

The Germans want to open the attribute configuration modal dialog when the user drops
an attribute on a node in order to effect a split at that node. 
This is reasonable.

We set it up so that it is an option. 
If you check the box on the options panel, the configuration dialog appears on drop.
